You normally use either require or dofile, depending of your situation. It is also possible to call the lower level functions loadfile or load if you need more flexibility.

require is used to load library modules. The argument is the name of the module, and Lua then searches for the file in the package.path path. It also maintains a cache of loaded modules, so that the second time you call require for the same name it will only return the cached value.

dofile is simpler. It just take the file path as argument. It loads and executes the code every time it is called.
